## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Using modern CSS resets. This threw me off a bit but I manage to land on my feet 

### Continued development

NIL

### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me align image and text in a div horizontally. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Modern CSS reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS reset. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
